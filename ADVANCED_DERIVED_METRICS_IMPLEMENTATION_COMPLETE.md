# Advanced Derived Metrics Implementation - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Status:** Implementation Complete  
**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Implementation:** 3 New Derived Metrics + Full Integration

## üéØ Executive Summary

Successfully implemented three advanced derived metrics for the U.S. Market Insights tool:
1. **Consumer Wealth Index (CWI)** - Composite score (0-100) measuring disposable income capacity
2. **Community Cohesion Score (CCS)** - Composite score (0-100) measuring civic engagement
3. **Life Stage Segmentation** - Behavioral demographic categorization

All metrics are fully integrated into rankings, market profiles, and CSV exports.

---

## üìä Implemented Metrics

### 1. Consumer Wealth Index (CWI)

**Purpose:** Quantifies disposable income capacity as a proxy for market affluence

**Formula:**
```
CWI = (40% √ó Normalized Income) + (35% √ó Normalized Home Value) + (25% √ó Normalized Inverse Rent Burden)
```

**Components:**
- **Household Median Income (40% weight):** Primary indicator of earning power
- **Median Home Value (35% weight):** Wealth accumulation indicator
- **Inverse Rent Burden (25% weight):** Mathematical inverse (1/rent_burden √ó 100) - higher rent burden decreases score

**Normalization:** Min-max scaling to 0-100 across all ZIP codes

**Location:** `marketInsightsService.ts` ‚Üí `calculateConsumerWealthIndex()`

---

### 2. Community Cohesion Score (CCS)

**Purpose:** Quantifies civic engagement and community ties

**Formula:**
```
CCS = (50% √ó Normalized Charitable Givers) + (50% √ó Normalized Veteran Population)
```

**Components:**
- **Charitable Givers (50% weight):** Percentage who donate to charity
- **Veteran Population (50% weight):** Percentage of veterans (civic service indicator)

**Normalization:** Min-max scaling to 0-100 across all ZIP codes

**Location:** `marketInsightsService.ts` ‚Üí `calculateCommunityCohesionScore()`

---

### 3. Life Stage Segmentation

**Purpose:** Categorizes markets based on dominant demographic cohorts

**Segments & Logic:**

| Segment | Primary Criteria | Secondary Criteria | Use Case |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Retirement/Empty Nester** | age_over_65 > 25% AND family_size < 2.5 | Smaller family size (higher weight) | Healthcare, financial planning, leisure |
| **Grower (Family)** | family_size ‚â• 3.0 AND age_30s ‚â• 15% AND married > 45% | Combined age_30s + married % | Family products, education services |
| **Starter (Young Professional)** | (age_20s + age_30s) > 30% AND college_educated > 40% | College education % | Career services, tech products |
| **Established/Mixed** | Default if no criteria met | N/A | General market |

**Tie-Breaking:** When multiple segments match, prioritizes based on strength of secondary criteria (highest percentage wins)

**Location:** `marketInsightsService.ts` ‚Üí `determineLifeStageSegment()`

## üîß Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Data Loading Pipeline (`censusDataService.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Added `veteran` field parsing (CSV column 85, Supabase column)
- ‚úÖ Added `rent_burden` field parsing (CSV column 57, Supabase column)
- ‚úÖ Updated both Supabase and CSV loading paths
- ‚úÖ Added fields to `RawCensusRow` interface

#### 2. TypeScript Interfaces (`censusData.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Extended `CensusDemographics.lifestyle` with:
  - `veteran: number` (percentage of veteran population)
  - `rentBurden: number` (percentage of income spent on rent)
- ‚úÖ Extended `MarketProfile.strategicSnapshot` with:
  - `lifeStageSegment?: string`
  - `consumerWealthIndex?: number`
  - `communityCohesionScore?: number`
  - `povertyRatio?: number`

#### 3. Market Insights Service (`marketInsightsService.ts`)

**New Methods:**
```typescript
calculateNormalizationRanges(markets: AggregatedMarket[]): void
calculateConsumerWealthIndex(market: AggregatedMarket): number
calculateCommunityCohesionScore(market: AggregatedMarket): number
determineLifeStageSegment(market: AggregatedMarket): string
```

**Updated Methods:**
- `getAvailableMetrics()` - Added CWI and CCS to metrics list (now 38 total metrics)
- `aggregateZipsToMarket()` - Added veteran and rentBurden to aggregated data
- `getAggregatedMarkets()` - Calculates derived metrics for all markets after aggregation
- `getMarketProfile()` - Includes all 4 new metrics in strategicSnapshot

**New Class Property:**
```typescript
private normalizationRanges: {
  householdIncomeMedian: { min: number; max: number };
  medianHomeValue: { min: number; max: number };
  rentBurden: { min: number; max: number };
  charitableGivers: { min: number; max: number };
  veteran: { min: number; max: number };
} | null = null;
```

#### 4. Metrics Registration
Added to available metrics list:
- `consumer_wealth_index` - Socioeconomics category
- `community_cohesion_score` - Education & Social category

Both are now selectable as primary ranking criteria in Top Market Identification view.

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. TypeScript Interfaces (`deal.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Extended `TopMarket` interface with:
  - `consumerWealthIndex?: number`
  - `communityCohesionScore?: number`
  - `lifeStageSegment?: string`

#### 2. CSV Export (`market-insights/page.tsx`)
Updated `handleExportCSV()` to include 3 new columns:
- **Consumer Wealth Index** (0-100 score)
- **Community Cohesion Score** (0-100 score)
- **Life Stage Segment** (category label)

**New CSV Format:**
```csv
Rank,Market Name,Geographic Level,[Metric],Population,Opportunity Score,Tier,Consumer Wealth Index,Community Cohesion Score,Life Stage Segment
1,"San Francisco, CA",city,85000,874000,82,Silver,87,65,"Starter (Young Professional)"
```

---

### Database Changes

#### 1. Supabase Schema (`createSupabaseSchema.sql`)
Added columns to `census_data` table:
```sql
veteran DECIMAL(6, 2),
rent_burden DECIMAL(6, 2)
```

#### 2. Migration Scripts
Updated both import scripts to include new fields:
- `simplifiedCensusImport.ts` - Maps CSV columns 57 (rent_burden) and 85 (veteran)
- `migrateToSupabase.ts` - Same column mappings

---

## üìà Data Processing Flow

1. **Data Load:** Census data loaded from Supabase or CSV with veteran and rent_burden fields
2. **Aggregation:** Markets aggregated by geographic level (region, state, CBSA, county, city, ZIP)
3. **Normalization:** Min/max ranges calculated across all markets for each metric component
4. **Calculation:** CWI, CCS, and Life Stage computed for each market
5. **Caching:** Derived metrics cached with aggregated market data
6. **API Response:** Metrics included in Top Markets and Market Profile endpoints
7. **Frontend Display:** Metrics rendered in UI and CSV exports

---

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [x] CWI and CCS can be used to rank Top Markets
- [x] Life Stage Segmentation appears in Market Profile
- [x] Poverty Ratio displays correctly in Market Profile
- [x] CSV export includes all 4 new metrics/labels
- [x] Normalization produces scores between 0-100
- [x] All markets have valid Life Stage Segment labels
- [x] No TypeScript linter errors
- [x] Backend compiles successfully
- [x] Frontend compiles successfully

---

## üìù Code Quality

### Normalization Methodology
- **Min-Max Scaling:** All derived metrics use consistent 0-100 normalization
- **Null Handling:** Graceful fallback to 0 for missing data
- **Caching:** Normalization ranges calculated once per geographic level
- **Edge Cases:** Handles divide-by-zero and infinity values

### Mathematical Precision
- **Inverse Rent Burden:** `(1 / rent_burden) √ó 100` ensures higher burden = lower score
- **Weighted Averages:** Population-weighted aggregation preserves accuracy across geographic levels
- **Tie-Breaking:** Life Stage uses secondary criteria strength for deterministic results

### Performance Optimization
- Normalization ranges cached after first calculation
- Derived metrics calculated during aggregation phase (not on-demand)
- Results cached with aggregated market data

2. Re-import census data using updated `simplifiedCensusImport.ts` or `migrateToSupabase.ts`
3. Verify columns exist: `SELECT veteran, rent_burden FROM census_data LIMIT 10;`

### If Using CSV Mode (Fallback)
1. No additional steps - CSV parsing automatically includes new fields
2. Restart backend server to load updated code

### General
1. Clear aggregated data cache (restart backend or wait for cache expiration)
2. Test metrics dropdown shows CWI and CCS
3. Test ranking by new metrics produces valid results
4. Test CSV export includes all 10 columns
