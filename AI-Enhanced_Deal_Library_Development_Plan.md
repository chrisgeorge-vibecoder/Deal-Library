# AI-Enhanced Deal Library Development Plan for Sovrn

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive development plan outlines the transformation of Sovrn's static Google Sheet of Deal IDs into a dynamic, AI-enhanced, and user-friendly web platform. The plan is structured in three phases: MVP (Google Sheets integration), API-driven system migration, and advanced AI features implementation.

## 1. Frontend Tech Stack

### Proposed Stack: **Next.js with React**

**Justification:**

- **Next.js Framework**: Built on React, providing server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for optimal performance and SEO
- **Component-Based Architecture**: React's component system enables reusable UI components for deal cards, search interfaces, and filtering systems
- **Built-in API Routes**: Next.js API routes allow seamless backend integration without separate server setup
- **Developer Experience**: Hot reloading, automatic code splitting, and TypeScript support for maintainable code
- **Performance**: Optimized bundle splitting and image optimization for fast loading times
- **SEO-Friendly**: Server-side rendering ensures search engines can properly index deal content

**Alternative Considered**: Vue.js with Nuxt.js
- **Rejected**: Smaller ecosystem compared to React, less enterprise adoption

## 2. Backend & Data Architecture

### Phase 1: MVP (Google Sheets as Source of Truth)
