## Recommendation for Scaling

4. **Result:** 199 personas (100% coverage) with consistent quality

**Benefits:**
- Every commerce segment has a persona
- Data-driven and accurate
- Can be regenerated as data updates
- Consistent format across all personas

**Next Steps (if you approve):**
- I can batch-generate personas for all missing segments
