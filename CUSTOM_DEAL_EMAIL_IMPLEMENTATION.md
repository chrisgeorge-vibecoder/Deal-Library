## Testing the Feature

3. Click "Request Custom Deal" button (in the header or wherever it appears)
4. Fill out the form:

   - Campaign Objectives: Testing the email feature
   - Target Audience: Test audience
   - (Optional fields as desired)

- **Sender:** onboarding@resend.dev (Resend's default test domain)
- **Reply-To:** Customer's email from the form
- **Subject:** "New Custom Deal Request from [Company Name]"

2. Add DNS records (SPF, DKIM)
3. Wait for verification

## Files Modified/Created

### Created
- `/deal-library-frontend/src/app/api/send-custom-deal-request/route.ts` - API endpoint
- `/deal-library-frontend/RESEND_SETUP.md` - Setup documentation
- `/deal-library-frontend/CUSTOM_DEAL_EMAIL_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This file

### Modified
- `/deal-library-frontend/src/components/CustomDealForm.tsx` - Added email functionality
- `/deal-library-frontend/package.json` - Added resend dependency

### Environment Files (Git-Ignored)
- `/deal-library-frontend/.env.local` - Needs to be created manually
- `/deal-library-frontend/.env.example` - Template for reference

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending?
1. Check `.env.local` has `RESEND_API_KEY` set
2. Verify API key is correct (starts with `re_`)
3. Restart the Next.js server
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Check server terminal for error messages

### API Key Invalid?
1. Make sure you copied the entire key
2. Don't include quotes around the key in `.env.local`
3. Regenerate the key if needed

### Form Shows Error?
1. Check network tab in browser dev tools
2. Verify all required fields are filled
3. Check that the API route is accessible at `/api/send-custom-deal-request`

## Rate Limits

**Free Tier:**
- 100 emails per day
- 3,000 emails per month

If you need more, Resend has affordable paid plans starting at $20/month for 50,000 emails.

## Security Notes

- `.env.local` is git-ignored and won't be committed to the repository
- API key should never be exposed to the frontend (it's used in the API route only)
- The API route validates all inputs before sending
- No sensitive data is logged to console in production

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Add CC Recipients** - Include other team members
2. **Save to Database** - Store requests in Supabase for reference
3. **Auto-Response Email** - Send confirmation to customer
4. **Slack Notification** - Alert team in Slack channel
5. **Email Templates** - Create multiple templates for different request types
6. **Rate Limiting** - Prevent spam submissions
7. **CAPTCHA** - Add bot protection
