# Campaign Brief Save Card Feature - Complete ‚úÖ

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Feature:** Convert AI Campaign Brief to saveable card with bookmark icon

---

## üéØ Overview

Successfully transformed the AI Campaign Brief from a temporary modal into a **persistent, saveable card** that follows the same user experience pattern as all other cards in the application. Users can now save campaign briefs to their Saved Cards panel and reopen them at any time.

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. Type Definitions (`types/deal.ts`)

**Added `CampaignBrief` interface:**
```typescript
export interface CampaignBrief {
  marketName: string;
  marketGeoLevel: string;
  marketPersonaSummary: string;
  targetedHeadlines: string[];
  valuePropositions: Array<{
    theme: string;
    rationale: string;
    priority: number;
  }>;
  generatedAt: string;
}
```

**Updated `SavedCard` type:**
- Added `'campaign-brief'` to the type union
- Added `CampaignBrief` to the data union

---

### 2. CampaignBriefModal Component

**Added save/unsave functionality:**
- New props: `marketGeoLevel`, `onSave`, `onUnsave`, `isSaved`
- Added `handleSaveToggle()` method to create `CampaignBrief` object
- Added **Bookmark icon** in header (next to close button)
- Icon toggles between `Bookmark` (unsaved) and `BookmarkCheck` (saved)
- Hover tooltips: "Save to cards" / "Remove from saved cards"

**Visual integration:**
- Bookmark button styled with white icon on gold gradient header
- Matches the design pattern of Market Profile save button
- Smooth hover effects with `hover:bg-white/20`

---

### 3. MarketProfile Component

**Updated CampaignBriefModal integration:**
```typescript
<CampaignBriefModal
  brief={campaignBrief}
  marketName={profile.name}
  marketGeoLevel={profile.geoLevel}  // NEW
  onClose={onCloseCampaignBrief}
  onSave={onSave as any}              // NEW
  onUnsave={onUnsave}                 // NEW
  isSaved={isSaved}                   // NEW
/>
```

Passes existing save/unsave handlers from Market Insights page.

---

### 4. SavedCards Component

**Added campaign-brief handling:**

**Icon:**
```typescript
case 'campaign-brief':
  return <Sparkles className="w-4 h-4 text-brand-gold" />;
```

**Title:**
```typescript
case 'campaign-brief':
  return `Campaign Brief: ${(card.data as CampaignBrief).marketName}`;
```

**Subtitle:**
```typescript
case 'campaign-brief':
  const brief = card.data as CampaignBrief;
  const briefGeoLevelLabel = brief.marketGeoLevel.charAt(0).toUpperCase() 
    + brief.marketGeoLevel.slice(1);
  return `${briefGeoLevelLabel} ‚Ä¢ AI Generated`;
```

**Card ID:**
```typescript
case 'campaign-brief':
  return `campaign-brief-${(card.data as CampaignBrief).marketGeoLevel}-${(card.data as CampaignBrief).marketName}`;
```

**Example display in sidebar:**
```
‚ú® Campaign Brief: San Francisco-Oakland-Berkeley, CA
   Cbsa ‚Ä¢ AI Generated
```

---

### 5. AppLayout Component

**Added state management:**
```typescript
const [selectedCampaignBrief, setSelectedCampaignBrief] = useState<any | null>(null);
const [isCampaignBriefModalOpen, setIsCampaignBriefModalOpen] = useState(false);
```

**Added handleCardClick case:**
```typescript
case 'campaign-brief':
  // Open campaign brief modal
  setSelectedCampaignBrief(card.data);
  setIsCampaignBriefModalOpen(true);
  break;
```

**Added getCardId case:**
```typescript
case 'campaign-brief':
  return `campaign-brief-${(card.data as any).marketGeoLevel}-${(card.data as any).marketName}`;
```

**Added modal render:**
```typescript
{isCampaignBriefModalOpen && selectedCampaignBrief && (
  <CampaignBriefModal
    brief={selectedCampaignBrief}
    marketName={selectedCampaignBrief.marketName}
    marketGeoLevel={selectedCampaignBrief.marketGeoLevel}
    onClose={() => {
      setIsCampaignBriefModalOpen(false);
      setSelectedCampaignBrief(null);
    }}
    onSave={handleSaveCard as any}
    onUnsave={handleUnsaveCard}
    isSaved={isCardSaved(`campaign-brief-${selectedCampaignBrief.marketGeoLevel}-${selectedCampaignBrief.marketName}`)}
  />
)}
```

**Added import:**
```typescript
import CampaignBriefModal from './CampaignBriefModal';
import { ..., CampaignBrief } from '@/types/deal';
```

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Data Structure

**Saved card object:**
```json
{
  "type": "campaign-brief",
  "data": {
    "marketName": "California",
    "marketGeoLevel": "state",
    "marketPersonaSummary": "A compelling 100-word persona...",
    "targetedHeadlines": [
      "Headline 1...",
      "Headline 2...",
      "Headline 3...",
      "Headline 4...",
      "Headline 5..."
    ],
    "valuePropositions": [
      { "theme": "Innovation", "rationale": "...", "priority": 1 },
      { "theme": "Sustainability", "rationale": "...", "priority": 2 },
      { "theme": "Accessibility", "rationale": "...", "priority": 3 }
    ],
    "generatedAt": "2025-10-28T10:30:00.000Z"
  },
  "savedAt": "2025-10-28T10:31:00.000Z"
}
```

### Card ID Generation

Format: `campaign-brief-{geoLevel}-{marketName}`

**Examples:**
- `campaign-brief-state-California`
- `campaign-brief-cbsa-San Francisco-Oakland-Berkeley, CA`
- `campaign-brief-city-Austin`

This ensures uniqueness and allows for easy lookup and deduplication.

### LocalStorage Integration

Campaign briefs are persisted in `localStorage` under the key `'savedCards'` along with all other saved cards, ensuring:
- ‚úÖ Data persists across browser sessions
- ‚úÖ No server-side storage required
- ‚úÖ Consistent with existing saved card behavior
