## Code Implementation

### **Import Statement:**
```tsx
import { 
  BarChart, Bar, XAxis, YAxis, CartesianGrid, Tooltip, Legend, 
  ResponsiveContainer, PieChart, Pie, Cell 
} from 'recharts';
```

### **Income Chart Example:**
```tsx
<ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={300}>
  <BarChart data={report.demographics.incomeDistribution}>
    <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3" />
    <XAxis dataKey="bracket" />
    <YAxis label={{ value: 'Percentage (%)', angle: -90 }} />
    <Tooltip />
    <Legend />
    <Bar dataKey="percentage" name="This Segment" fill="#f97316" />
    <Bar dataKey="nationalAvg" name="US National Avg" fill="#94a3b8" />
  </BarChart>
</ResponsiveContainer>
```

**Data Format (Already Provided by Backend):**
```json
"incomeDistribution": [
  { "bracket": "$100k-$150k", "percentage": 31.07, "nationalAvg": 15 },
  { "bracket": "$50k-$75k", "percentage": 29.21, "nationalAvg": 25 },
  ...
]
```

**No data transformation needed!** Charts work directly with backend data structure.

---

## Visual Design

### **Color Palette:**
- **Brand Orange:** `#f97316` (segment data - primary)
- **Blue:** `#3b82f6` (secondary tier)
- **Green:** `#10b981` (tertiary tier)
- **Purple:** `#8b5cf6` (age/education)
- **Gray:** `#94a3b8` (national average - reference)

### **Styling:**
- White backgrounds with subtle borders
- Rounded corners (8px)
- Hover states for interactivity
- Tooltips with detailed information
- Legends where needed
- Explanatory text below charts

---

## Responsive Behavior

**Desktop (>768px):**
- Income chart: Full width
- Education + Age: Side-by-side (2 columns)

**Mobile (<768px):**
- All charts: Full width stacked
- Pie chart labels may wrap (still readable)
- Tooltips work on touch

**ResponsiveContainer:**
- Automatically adjusts to parent width
- Maintains aspect ratio
- Reflows on window resize

---

## Alternative Libraries (NOT Used)

### Why NOT These:

**D3.js:**
- ❌ Too complex (steep learning curve)
- ❌ Low-level (requires manual everything)
- ❌ Not React-friendly (needs refs, manual DOM manipulation)
- ✅ But: Most powerful and flexible

**Chart.js:**
- ❌ Not built for React (needs wrapper)
- ❌ Imperative API (not declarative)
- ✅ But: Smaller bundle size

**Victory:**
- ❌ Larger bundle (~300KB)
- ❌ Less active maintenance
- ✅ But: More animation options

**Plotly:**
- ❌ Very large bundle (>1MB)
- ❌ Overkill for simple charts
- ✅ But: 3D charts, scientific plots

**✅ Recharts is the sweet spot** for this use case:
- React-first (declarative API)
- Reasonable bundle size
- Beautiful defaults
- Easy to customize
- Active community

## Data Flow

### **Backend Provides:**
```json
"demographics": {
  "incomeDistribution": [
    { "bracket": "$100k-$150k", "percentage": 31.07, "nationalAvg": 15 },
    ...
  ],
  "educationLevels": [
    { "level": "High School or Less", "percentage": 73.31 },
    { "level": "Bachelor's Degree", "percentage": 5.67 },
    ...
  ],
  "ageDistribution": [
    { "bracket": "30-39", "percentage": 88.27 },
    ...

After: +150KB for Recharts
Impact: ~2-3% increase in bundle size
Worth it: YES - essential data visualization
```
