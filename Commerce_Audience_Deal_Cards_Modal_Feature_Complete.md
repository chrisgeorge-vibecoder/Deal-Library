# Commerce Audience Insights - Deal Card Modal & Save Feature Complete

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented modal and save functionality for deal cards in the Commerce Audience Insights tool.

## Changes Made

### 1. Audience Insights Page (`deal-library-frontend/src/app/audience-insights/page.tsx`)

#### Added Imports:
- `DealDetailModal` component
- `Deal` type
- `BookmarkCheck` icon from lucide-react

#### Added State Management:
- `isDealModalOpen` - Controls modal visibility
- `selectedDeal` - Stores currently selected deal
- `savedDealIds` - Set of saved deal IDs for tracking saved state

#### Added Event Handlers:
- `handleDealClick(deal)` - Opens modal with selected deal
- `handleCloseDealModal()` - Closes the modal
- `handleSaveDeal(card)` - Saves deal card to localStorage and dispatches event
- `handleUnsaveDeal(cardId)` - Removes deal card from saved cards
- `isDealSaved(cardId)` - Checks if a deal is saved
- `handleAddToCart(deal)` - Dispatches addToCart event to AppLayout
- `handleRemoveFromCart(dealId)` - Dispatches removeFromCart event to AppLayout
- `isInCart(dealId)` - Placeholder for cart state checking

#### Enhanced Deal Cards:
- Added **bookmark icon** (top-right corner) showing save status
  - Blue/filled when saved
  - Gray/outline when not saved
- Made deal card body clickable to open modal
- Bookmark button uses `stopPropagation()` to prevent modal opening when clicked
- Cards now track their saved state with visual feedback

#### Added Modal Component:
- `DealDetailModal` rendered at bottom of page
- Fully integrated with save/unsave functionality
- Shows detailed deal information
- Includes cart add/remove functionality
- Has bookmark button in header

### 2. AppLayout Component (`deal-library-frontend/src/components/AppLayout.tsx`)

#### Added Event Listeners:
- `handleAddToCartEvent` - Listens for 'addToCart' custom events
- `handleRemoveFromCartEvent` - Listens for 'removeFromCart' custom events
- Properly registered and cleaned up in useEffect

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Modal Functionality
1. **Click to Open**: Deal cards open detailed modal view
2. **Full Deal Details**: Shows complete deal information including:
   - Deal name and ID
   - Description
   - Environment and media type
   - Targeting information
   - Bid guidance
   - Persona insights (if available)

### ✅ Save Card Feature
1. **Visual Bookmark Icon**: Each deal card shows save status
2. **Persistent Storage**: Saved cards stored in localStorage
3. **Real-time Updates**: UI updates immediately on save/unsave
4. **Integration**: Saved deals appear in Strategy Cards sidebar
5. **AppLayout Integration**: Uses existing saveCard event system

### ✅ Cart Integration
1. **Add to Cart**: Modal includes "Add to Selections" button
2. **Remove from Cart**: Shows "Remove from Selections" when in cart
3. **Event System**: Uses custom events to communicate with AppLayout
4. **Cart State**: Properly tracks cart state across the app

## User Experience

### Before:
- Deal cards were static and navigated to main page
- No way to save deals from Audience Insights
- No detailed view of deals

### After:
- Deal cards are interactive with hover effects
- Click card → Opens detailed modal
- Click bookmark → Saves/unsaves card instantly
- Modal shows all deal details
- Can add deals to cart from modal
- Visual feedback for saved state
- Seamless integration with existing saved cards system

## Technical Details

### Event System:
```javascript
// Save card
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('saveCard', { detail: card }));

// Add to cart
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('addToCart', { detail: { deal } }));

// Remove from cart
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('removeFromCart', { detail: { dealId } }));
```

### State Management:
- Local state for modal open/close
- LocalStorage for persistent saved cards
- Set data structure for efficient saved card lookups
- Custom events for cross-component communication

### Styling:
- Bookmark icon positioned absolutely (top-right)
- Blue theme for saved state
- Gray theme for unsaved state
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Commerce audience deals have gold accent
