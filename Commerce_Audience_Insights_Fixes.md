# Commerce Audience Insights Report - Fixes Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Creative Hooks Display Issue ✅
**Problem:** Creative Hooks were showing "[object Object]" instead of properly formatted text.

**Root Cause:** The `messagingRecommendations` array was changed from strings to objects with properties like:
- `valueProposition`
- `dataBacking`
- `emotionalBenefit`
- `campaignReady`

The frontend code was trying to display these objects directly as strings, which resulted in "[object Object]".

**Solution:** Updated the frontend code in `/deal-library-frontend/src/app/audience-insights/page.tsx` to:
1. Check if the message is an object or string
2. For objects: Extract the `valueProposition` property and display it
3. For legacy strings: Continue to display them as before
4. Added a tooltip showing the emotional benefit when hovering over Creative Hooks

**Changes Made:**
- Line 819-840: Updated Creative Hooks display to handle both object and string formats
- Line 1574-1581: Updated text export to properly format object-based recommendations

### 2. Bold Text Formatting Issue ✅
**Problem:** Markdown bold syntax (`**text**`) was showing up literally instead of being rendered as bold text.

**Root Cause:** The text was being stripped of markdown (`replace(/\*\*/g, '')`) instead of being rendered as HTML.

**Solution:** Applied the existing `renderMarkdown()` helper function to convert `**text**` to `<strong>text</strong>`:
1. In Creative Hooks section: Already removing `**` for display (correct behavior for badges)
2. In Messaging Recommendations section: Now using `renderMarkdown()` to properly display bold text

**Changes Made:**
- Line 1394: Applied `renderMarkdown()` to `valueProposition`
- Line 1402: Applied `renderMarkdown()` to `dataBacking`
- Line 1410: Applied `renderMarkdown()` to `emotionalBenefit`

## How It Works Now

### Creative Hooks Section
The Creative Hooks section now:
- Displays the `valueProposition` from each messaging recommendation object
- Shows up to 3 hooks as colored badges
- Removes markdown formatting for clean badge display
- Shows the emotional benefit as a tooltip on hover

### Messaging Recommendations Section
The Messaging Recommendations section now:
- Properly renders bold text using `**text**` syntax
- Displays structured data with clear sections:
  - Value Proposition (main message)
  - Data Insights (supporting data)
  - Emotional Benefits (emotional appeal)
  - Campaign Ready indicator

### Text Export
The text export now:
- Properly extracts `valueProposition` from object-based recommendations
- Falls back to string format for legacy data
- Removes markdown formatting for plain text export

## Testing
After deploying, test by:
1. Generate a Commerce Audience Insights report
2. Check that Creative Hooks display actual text (not "[object Object]")
3. Check that bold text in Messaging Recommendations displays correctly
4. Check that text export includes proper Creative Hooks

## Files Modified
- `/deal-library-frontend/src/app/audience-insights/page.tsx`

## No Breaking Changes
- Backward compatible with legacy string-based messaging recommendations
- All existing functionality preserved
