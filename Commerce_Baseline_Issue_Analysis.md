# Commerce Baseline Issue - Deep Analysis üîç

## The Problem

**EVERY segment shows negative for BOTH income AND education vs commerce baseline.**

### Test Results:
| Segment | Income | vs Commerce | Education | vs Commerce |
|---------|--------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Audio | $71,972 | **-13.0%** | 30.1% | **-19.4%** |
| Golf | $74,123 | **-10.4%** | 33.5% | **-10.4%** |
| Computer Components | $70,420 | **-14.9%** | 35.0% | **-6.4%** |
| Office Furniture | $71,784 | **-13.2%** | 30.1% | **-19.6%** |
| Vitamins & Supplements | $70,420 | **-14.9%** | 35.0% | **-6.4%** |
| Pet Supplies | $75,000~ | **-9%** | 35.0% | **-6.5%** |

**100% of segments are below baseline for BOTH metrics!**

### Commerce Baseline:
- **Income:** $82,730
- **Education:** 37.4%

## Statistical Impossibility

If the commerce baseline represents "typical online shoppers" aggregated from ALL segments, then:

**Mathematically, it's IMPOSSIBLE for every individual segment to be below the aggregate!**

Some segments MUST be above the baseline (otherwise the baseline wouldn't be that high).

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### **How Commerce Baseline is Calculated:**

1. Get top 200 ZIPs for EACH of 196 segments
2. Aggregate all commerce weights by ZIP
3. Take top 1000 ZIPs by TOTAL commerce activity
4. Calculate demographics from these 1000 ZIPs

### **The Flaw:**

**The top 1000 ZIPs by TOTAL activity are NOT representative of any individual segment!**

**Why:**
- A ZIP might have LOW activity for Audio ($1,000 weight)
- But HIGH activity for 50 other segments ($50,000 total weight)
- This ZIP gets included in the baseline (top 1000 total)
- But it's NOT representative of Audio shoppers!

**The baseline is capturing:**
- ZIPs that are active across MANY segments
- These are likely affluent, educated urban areas (buy everything online)
- Individual segments are more concentrated in specific markets

---

## Visual Example

### **Commerce Baseline (Top 1000 Total Activity):**
```
ZIP 10001 (NYC):
- Audio: 1,000 weight (not in Audio top 50)
- Pet Supplies: 5,000
- Golf: 3,000
- Computer: 8,000
- ... 50 other segments
TOTAL: 100,000 weight ‚Üí INCLUDED IN BASELINE

Demographics:
- Income: $120,000 (wealthy NYC)
- Education: 60% (urban professional)
```

### **Audio Segment (Top 50 Audio Activity):**
```
ZIP 30349 (Atlanta suburb):
- Audio: 109,232 weight (TOP Audio ZIP!)
- Other segments: minimal activity
TOTAL: 120,000 weight ‚Üí NOT in baseline top 1000

Demographics:
- Income: $64,732 (suburban family)
- Education: 31.7% (working class)
```

**Result:**
- Baseline captures wealthy multi-segment urban ZIPs ($82k, 37% edu)
- Segments capture their own specific markets ($72k, 30% edu)
- ALL segments look worse than baseline!

---

## The Correct Solution

### **Option 1: Change Baseline to Median of All Segments** ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED

Instead of aggregating ZIPs, aggregate SEGMENT medians:

```typescript
// For each segment:
const segments = getAllSegments();
const segmentMedians = segments.map(seg => ({
  segment: seg,
  income: calculateMedianIncome(seg),
  education: calculateMedianEducation(seg)
}));

// Commerce baseline = median of all segment medians
const baselineIncome = median(segmentMedians.map(s => s.income));
const baselineEducation = median(segmentMedians.map(s => s.education));
```

**This would give us:**
- Income baseline: ~$72k (median of all segments)
- Education baseline: ~33% (median of all segments)
- Then about 50% of segments would be above, 50% below ‚úÖ

---

### **Option 2: Random Sample of Commerce ZIPs**

Instead of top 1000 by total activity, random sample 1000 ZIPs with commerce activity:

**Pros:**
- Unbiased representation
- Would capture typical online shoppers

**Cons:**
- Computationally expensive
- Still might not represent individual segments well

---

### **Option 3: Keep Current, Change Interpretation**

Keep the baseline but acknowledge it represents "HIGHLY ACTIVE multi-category shoppers" not "typical online shoppers":

**Relabel:**
- "vs Commerce Baseline" ‚Üí "vs Power Shoppers"
- Explanation: "Power shoppers are affluent urbanites who shop across many categories"

---

## Recommendation

### **Implement Option 1: Segment Median Baseline**

**Why:**
- Statistically sound
- True "typical online shopper" across all categories
- Will show natural variation (50% above, 50% below)
- Easy to calculate (we already have the data!)

**Estimated effort:** 1 hour

**Would fix:**
- ‚úÖ Golf (affluent) would be ABOVE baseline for income
- ‚úÖ Pet Supplies (mid-tier) would be NEAR baseline
- ‚úÖ Audio (blue-collar) would be BELOW baseline
- ‚úÖ Realistic, actionable insights

---

## Quick Test: What SHOULD the Baseline Be?

Based on our tests:
- Audio: $72k
- Golf: $74k
- Computer Components: $70k
- Office Furniture: $72k
- Pet Supplies: $75k

**Median of these 5: ~$72,000**

**Current baseline: $82,730** ‚Üê 15% TOO HIGH!

**Should I implement Option 1 (Segment Median Baseline)?** This will fix the systematic bias issue.
