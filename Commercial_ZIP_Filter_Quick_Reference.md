# Commercial ZIP Filter - Quick Reference

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete!

### What Changed:

**New checkbox added below segment selector:**
```
‚òê Include downtown commercial ZIPs (offices, low residential pop)
üí° Enable for B2B segments. Disable for consumer segments.
```

**Default:** UNCHECKED (excludes commercial ZIPs)

---

## What Gets Filtered (When Unchecked):

**Downtown Commercial ZIPs:**
- Population < 10,000
- Examples: 60602 Chicago, 75270 Dallas, 10004 NYC, 20024 DC
- Characteristics: Offices, high volume, extreme over-index

**Why Filter:**
