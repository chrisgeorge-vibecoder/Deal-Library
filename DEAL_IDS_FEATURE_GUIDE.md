## üîç How It Works

### **Matching Logic:**

The tool finds deals that match **either**:
- The **primary audience segment** (e.g., "Camping & Hiking")
- The **overlapping audience** (e.g., "Sporting Goods")

### **Prioritization:**

Deals are sorted by relevance:
1. **Deals matching BOTH segments** (primary + overlap) appear first
2. Deals matching only one segment appear next
3. **Top 5 most relevant** deals are displayed

---

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Data Structure:**

```javascript
const dealsDatabase = [
    {
        dealId: "SPORT-001",
        dealName: "Athletic Performance Network",
        targeting: "Athletics, Sporting Goods, Exercise & Fitness",
        segments: ["Athletics", "Sporting Goods", "Exercise & Fitness", ...],
        bidGuidance: "$3.50 - $4.50 CPM"
    },
    // ... more deals
];
```

### **Matching Function:**

```javascript
function findRelevantDeals(segment, overlapProduct) {
    // 1. Find deals matching primary segment OR overlap
    // 2. Sort by relevance (matching both > matching one)
    // 3. Return top 5
}
```

---

## üîÑ Updating the Deals

### **Option 1: Edit the HTML File (Quick)**

For temporary updates or testing:

1. Open the HTML file
2. Find the `dealsDatabase` array (around line 677)
3. Add, remove, or modify deals
4. Save and reload

### **Option 2: Connect to Your Backend API (Production)**

For dynamic, real-time deal data:

```javascript
// Replace the embedded dealsDatabase with an API call
async function loadDeals() {
    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3002/api/deals');
    const deals = await response.json();
    // Transform to match the format
    return deals.map(deal => ({
        dealId: deal.dealId,
        dealName: deal.dealName,
        targeting: deal.targeting,
        segments: extractSegments(deal.targeting),
        bidGuidance: deal.bidGuidance
    }));
}
```

### **Option 3: Fetch from Google Sheets**

If your deals are in Google Sheets:

```javascript
async function loadDealsFromSheets() {
    const response = await fetch(GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL + '?action=getDeals');
    const deals = await response.json();
    // Transform to match format
}
```

---

## üé® Customization

### **Change CPM Badge Color:**

In the CSS (around line 337):

```css
.deal-cpm {
    background: #d4e8d4;  /* Change this */
    color: #2d5016;       /* And this */
}
```

### **Change Border Color:**

```css
.deals-list li {
    border-left: 4px solid #2F4A7C;  /* Change this */
}
```

### **Show More/Fewer Deals:**

In `findRelevantDeals()` function (line 1372):

```javascript
return relevantDeals.slice(0, 5);  // Change 5 to any number
```

---

## üìè Height Considerations

### **For Confluence:**

The Deal IDs section adds ~300-500px to the page height.

**Updated iframe height recommendation:**

```html
<iframe height="3100px">  <!-- Increased from 2800px -->
```

**Height breakdown:**
- Original content: ~2,500px
- Deal IDs section: ~300-500px (varies by number of deals)
- **Total:** ~2,800-3,000px
- **Recommended:** `3100px` (with buffer)
