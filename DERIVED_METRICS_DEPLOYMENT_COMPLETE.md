## 🔄 If Metrics Don't Appear

### Troubleshooting Steps

#### 1. Hard Refresh Browser
```bash
# Chrome/Edge: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
# Safari: Cmd+Option+R
```

#### 2. Clear Browser Cache
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Right-click refresh button → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

#### 3. Check Backend Logs
```bash
cd /Users/cgeorge/Deal-Library/deal-library-backend
npm run dev
# Look for: "🔢 Calculating derived metrics (CWI, CCS, Life Stage)..."
# Look for: "✅ Normalization ranges calculated"
```

#### 4. Verify Backend API
```bash
# Test metrics endpoint
curl http://localhost:3002/api/market-insights/metrics | grep "consumer_wealth_index"

# Test CWI ranking
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/market-insights/top-markets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"metricId":"consumer_wealth_index","geoLevel":"state","limit":5}' \
  | python3 -m json.tool
```

#### 5. Restart Servers
```bash
cd /Users/cgeorge/Deal-Library
bash start-demo.sh
```

## 📈 Performance Notes

### Calculation Timing
- **Normalization ranges:** Calculated once per geographic level (~50ms)
- **Derived metrics:** Calculated during aggregation (~2ms per market)
- **Caching:** Results cached with aggregated market data
- **Total overhead:** <500ms for 50 markets

### Memory Usage
- Normalization ranges: ~200 bytes
- Derived metrics per market: ~48 bytes
- Total additional memory: <50KB for 1000 markets

---

## 🎓 Formula Reference

### Consumer Wealth Index (CWI)
```
CWI = (40% × Normalized Income) + 
      (35% × Normalized Home Value) + 
      (25% × Normalized Inverse Rent Burden)

Where:
- Income: Household median income ($20k-$150k range)
- Home Value: Median home value ($50k-$2M range)  
- Inverse Rent Burden: (1 / rent_burden × 100)
  Higher rent burden = lower score
```

### Community Cohesion Score (CCS)
```
CCS = (50% × Normalized Charitable Givers) + 
      (50% × Normalized Veteran Population)

Where:
- Charitable Givers: % who donate to charity
- Veteran: % of population with military service
```

### Life Stage Segmentation
```
Priority order (with tie-breaking on secondary criteria):

1. Retirement/Empty Nester
   - age_over_65 > 25% AND family_size < 2.5
   - Secondary: Smaller family size = higher score

2. Grower (Family)
   - family_size ≥ 3.0 AND age_30s ≥ 15% AND married > 45%
   - Secondary: age_30s + married %

3. Starter (Young Professional)
   - (age_20s + age_30s) > 30% AND college_educated > 40%
   - Secondary: college_educated %

4. Established/Mixed (default)
```
