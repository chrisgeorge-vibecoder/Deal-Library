### **2. Renamed "Executive Summary" → "The Who & The Why"** ✅

**Together:** Persona provides quick inspiration, section below provides deep analysis

### **3. Persona Name Generation Logic** ✅

**Auto-generates names based on data characteristics:**

| Characteristics | Persona Name Pattern | Example |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------|
| Low education (-15%) + Family + Mid income | "The Practical [Segment] Family Builder" | Audio → "The Practical Audio Family Builder" |
| Low education + No family + Mid income | "The Hands-On [Segment] Professional" | Components → "The Hands-On Components Professional" |
| High income (+15%) + High education (+10%) | "The Affluent [Segment] Enthusiast" | Golf → "The Affluent Golf Enthusiast" |
| High income + Any education | "The Premium [Segment] Buyer" | Luxury items |
| Family + Baby overlap | "The Family-First [Segment] Parent" | Baby products |
| Family + No baby overlap | "The Family-Focused [Segment] Shopper" | Home goods |
| Low income (-15%) | "The Value-Conscious [Segment] Buyer" | Budget items |
| Default | "The [Segment] Consumer" | Fallback |

**Based on:**
- Income vs commerce baseline
- Education vs commerce baseline
- Household size (family indicator)
- Top behavioral overlap

### **4. Category Emoji Mapping** ✅

**All 19 Google Product Taxonomy categories covered:**

| Category | Emoji |
|----------|-------|
| Animals & Pet Supplies | 🐾 |
