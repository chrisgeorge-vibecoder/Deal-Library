**From Analysis:**
```
Bottom 10 Segments:
1. Arcade Equipment: 28.92%
2. Components: 29.17%
3. Dog Supplies: 29.43% ← YOU TESTED THIS
4. Circuit Boards & Components: 29.64%

## The Income-Education Paradox

### Fascinating Finding:

**High Income Segments (>$85k):**
- Average Education: **38.17%**
- Examples: Golf (42.45%), Fireplaces (42.67%), Kitchen Appliances (49.95%)

**Low Income Segments (<$75k):**
- Average Education: **31.05%**
- Examples: Dog Supplies (29.43%), Arcade Equipment (28.92%)

**Correlation:** POSITIVE (higher income = more education)

### **BUT:**

Many segments show **"Blue-Collar Prosperity"**:
- High income ($80k+)
- Low education (29-32%)
- Examples: Dog Supplies, Components, Gardening

**This is real data showing:**
- Trade-skilled workers (plumbers, electricians)
- Entrepreneurs (didn't need college)
- Successful blue-collar careers

## Sample ZIP Analysis: The Smoking Gun

### Sample ZIP from Highest Education Segment:
```
ZIP 10004 (New York, New York): 90.9% Bachelor's+
```

**90.9% education in a single ZIP?!**

### This Reveals the Real Issue:

**Downtown commercial ZIPs have EXTREME education levels:**
- 10004 NYC Financial District: 90.9% (office workers, finance professionals)
- These are daytime office populations, not residential

**When averaged into segment:**
- High-education downtown ZIPs pull average UP
- But you excluded them with the commercial ZIP filter!

## The Actual Problem: Data Quality in Census

### Check This Out:

**US National Average Education:** ~35% Bachelor's+

**Your Commerce Segments Average:** 33.70%

**Difference:** Only -1.3%!

### But Individual Segments Show:
- Dog Supplies: 29.43% (-5.6% vs national)
- Office Furniture: ~18% (you reported)
- Audio: ~18% (you reported)

### **Why Such Low Values?**

Let me check the raw census data quality:

<function_calls>
<invoke name="run_terminal_cmd">
<parameter name="command">cd "/Users/cgeorge/Deal Library/deal-library-backend/data" && echo "Checking education data in census file:" && echo "" && echo "Sample of education_bachelors column:" && head -100 uszips.csv | tail -50 | cut -d',' -f64 | head -20 && echo "" && echo "Checking for zero/empty education values:" && tail -n +2 uszips.csv | awk -F',' 'BEGIN{zero=0; empty=0; valid=0} {if ($64 == "0" || $64 == "\"0\"") zero++; else if ($64 == "" || $64 == "\"\"") empty++; else valid++} END {print "Zero values: " zero; print "Empty values: " empty; print "Valid values: " valid}'
