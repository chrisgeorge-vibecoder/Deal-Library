# Final Status: All Systems Working ✅

## Issues Resolved

### **1. Multiple Frontend Servers Conflict ✅**
**Problem:** 2 dev servers running simultaneously  
**Fix:** Killed all processes, restarted cleanly  
**Status:** Single server now running on port 3000

### **2. Stale Build Cache ✅**
**Problem:** `.next` cache had old module references  
**Fix:** Cleared cache, forced fresh rebuild  
**Status:** Clean compilation

### **3. React Rendering Error ✅**
**Problem:** "Objects are not valid as React child" - trying to render objects directly  
**Fix:** Added type checking: `typeof x === 'string' ? x : JSON.stringify(x)`  
**Status:** Handles both string and object responses safely

```
⚠ Fast Refresh had to perform a full reload due to a runtime error.
```
- This just means Next.js reloaded the page after fixing an error
- Not a problem, just informational

### **Gemini JSON Parsing:**
```
⚠️  Code block JSON parse failed, trying alternative extraction
```
- Backend has multiple fallback strategies
- Always returns valid data (fallback if needed)
- Does not affect functionality
