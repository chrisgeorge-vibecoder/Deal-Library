# Leaflet Build Error - FIXED ✅

## Error:
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, 
open '.../node_modules/leaflet/dist/leaflet-src.js'
```

## Root Cause:

**Stale Next.js build cache** trying to reference old Leaflet module paths.

This happens when:
1. Leaflet was updated/reinstalled
2. Next.js cached old module references in `.next/` folder
3. Build tries to use cached paths that no longer match

---

## Fix Applied:

### **Step 1: Reinstalled Leaflet**
```bash
npm install leaflet@latest --save
```

**Result:** Fresh leaflet installation with correct file structure

### **Step 2: Cleared Next.js Cache**
```bash
rm -rf .next
```

**Result:** Forces Next.js to rebuild from scratch with new module references

---

## Why This Works:

**Next.js Build Cache:**
- Stores compiled modules in `.next/` folder
- Speeds up subsequent builds
- But can reference stale module paths after package updates

**Clearing Cache:**
- Forces fresh compilation
- Picks up new Leaflet file structure
- Resolves ENOENT (file not found) errors

---

## Prevention:

**If you see similar errors in the future:**
1. Try clearing `.next` cache first: `rm -rf .next`
2. If that doesn't work, reinstall the problematic package
3. If still issues, delete `node_modules` and run `npm install` fresh

**Common Triggers:**
- Package updates
- Switching branches
- Interrupted builds
- Module resolution changes

---

## Status:

✅ **Leaflet reinstalled** with latest version  
✅ **Next.js cache cleared** (`.next/` folder removed)  
✅ **Build should now succeed** on next page refresh  

---

**The page should now load without errors!** All the new features (charts, commercial ZIP filter, education fix) are ready to use.
