## API Routes Removed

### Local Activation Endpoints (Backend)
- `POST /api/local-activation/top-markets`

- `GET /api/local-activation/market/:marketId/opportunities`
- `GET /api/local-activation/segments`

- `POST /api/geo-expansion/recommend`
- `GET /api/geo-expansion/market/:marketId/details`
- `GET /api/geo-expansion/segments`

## UI Changes

### Navigation (Sidebar)
**Removed**:
- "Local Activation Planner" link with Target icon from the Plan section

**Remaining Navigation**:
- Plan Section:
  - Audience Insights
  - Research Library
  - Strategy Cards
- Activate Section:
  - Deal Library

### Icons
Removed `Target` icon import from Sidebar component (no longer needed).

## Code Changes

### `deal-library-backend/src/index.ts`
- Removed all 4 Local Activation API route handlers
- Removed all 4 Geographic Expansion API route handlers
- Removed console.log statements for both feature sets
- File reduced by approximately 270 lines

### `deal-library-frontend/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`
- Removed `Target` icon import
- Removed "Local Activation Planner" navigation link
- Sidebar now has cleaner, more focused navigation

## Verification

### Backend Status
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Backend server running on port 3001
- ✅ Health check endpoint responding: `{"status": "OK"}`
- ✅ No lingering references to localActivation or geoExpansion services
- ✅ No compilation errors or warnings

### API Verification
The following endpoints now return 404 (as expected):
- `/api/local-activation/*` (all routes)
- `/api/geo-expansion/*` (all routes)

### Frontend Status
- ✅ No linter errors in modified files
- ✅ No broken navigation links
- ✅ Sidebar renders correctly without Local Activation link

## Remaining Features

Sovrn Launchpad now includes:

**Planning Tools**:
- Audience Insights (audience-geo-analysis)
- Research Library (with RAG and PDF processing)
- Strategy Cards (persona-based insights)

**Activation Tools**:
- Deal Library (marketplace deals browser)

**Core AI Capabilities**:
- Unified search across all data sources
- Gemini AI integration with RAG
- Audience segmentation and insights
- Market sizing and geographic analysis
- SWOT analysis and company profiling
- Custom deal requests

## Rationale for Removal

The Local Activation Planner was removed because:
1. It did not provide sufficient value for marketers running national/global campaigns
2. The feature was still in experimental stage
3. Cost data reliability issues (venue pricing, event sponsorships vary widely)
4. User feedback indicated limited utility for the primary use cases

The Geographic Expansion feature was removed because:
1. It was superseded by the Local Activation Planner
2. Never fully productionized or exposed to users
3. Similar functionality can be achieved through Audience Insights
4. Reduced complexity in the codebase

## Impact Assessment

**No Breaking Changes**:
- All other features remain fully functional
- No dependencies on the removed features
- No data migration required (features were not storing persistent data)

**Performance Impact**:
- Reduced bundle size (removed ~2000+ lines of code)
- Faster backend startup (fewer route registrations)
- Cleaner API surface area

**Maintenance Benefits**:
- Simplified codebase
- Fewer dependencies to maintain
- More focused feature set
- Easier onboarding for new developers

## Next Steps

If geographic or local activation features are needed in the future, they can be:
1. Rebuilt from scratch with clearer requirements
2. Integrated directly into Audience Insights
3. Offered as a separate tool outside Sovrn Launchpad

The architecture is now cleaner and more maintainable, focusing on the core value proposition of Sovrn Launchpad.
