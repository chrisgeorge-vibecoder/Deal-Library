# Market Sizing Keyword Detection - FIXED ✅

## Problem

**User Query:**
> "I'm a Media Director building a pet related media strategy. Help me understand market trends."

**User Action:** Selected "Market Sizing" card button

**Expected:** Market sizing cards with industry trends and market analysis

**Actual:** Received Deals instead (pet-related deals)

---

## Root Cause

### **Market Sizing Keywords Were Too Narrow:**

**Before:**
```typescript
const marketSizingKeywords = [
  'market sizing', 
  'market size', 
  'total addressable market', 
  'tam', 
  'market opportunity'
];
```

**User's Query:** "understand **market trends**"

**Result:** Didn't match any keywords → Fell through to deal search

---

## Solution

### **Expanded Market Sizing Keywords:**

**After:**
```typescript
const marketSizingKeywords = [
  'market sizing', 
  'market size', 
  'total addressable market', 
  'tam', 
  'market opportunity',
  'market trends',      // NEW
  'market analysis',    // NEW
  'industry trends',    // NEW
  'market growth'       // NEW
];
```

**Now Matches:**
- "market trends" ✅
- "industry trends" ✅
- "market analysis" ✅
- "market growth" ✅
- All original keywords ✅

---

## How It Works

### **Query Processing Order:**

1. **Check for explicit deal keywords** (e.g., "provide relevant deals")
   - If match → Fetch deals
   
2. **Check for persona keywords** (e.g., "personas", "buyer")
   - If match → Fetch personas
   
3. **Check for audience insights keywords** (e.g., "audience analysis")
   - If match → Fetch audience insights
   
4. **Check for market sizing keywords** (e.g., "market trends") ← FIXED
   - If match → Fetch market sizing
   
5. **Check for geo keywords** (e.g., "geographic", "location")
   - If match → Fetch geo cards
   
6. **Default:** Fall through to unified search

**Also checks `cardTypes` array** if user explicitly selected a card type button.
