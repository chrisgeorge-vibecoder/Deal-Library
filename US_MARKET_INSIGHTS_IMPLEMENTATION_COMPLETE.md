curl http://localhost:3002/api/market-insights/metrics

# 2. Get top states by median income
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/market-insights/top-markets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"metricId":"income_household_median","geoLevel":"state","limit":10}'

# 3. Get market profile for California
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/market-insights/profile \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"geoLevel":"state","marketName":"California"}'
```

### Frontend Testing
