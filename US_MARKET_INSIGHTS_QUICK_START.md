## Reading the Strategic Snapshot

The **Strategic Market Snapshot** is the tool's signature feature - it automatically identifies what makes a market unique:

### Top Strengths (Green) ‚úÖ
Attributes where the market significantly **exceeds** national average
- **Example:** "Median Household Income: $85,000 (35% above national average)"
- **Insight:** This market has higher purchasing power than typical

### Key Considerations (Red) ‚ö†Ô∏è
Attributes where the market significantly **lags** national average
- **Example:** "Population 18-24: 6.2% (20% below national average)"
- **Insight:** Fewer young adults - adjust youth-focused campaigns

### Using These Insights
1. **Identify opportunity areas** - Strengths suggest where to lean in
2. **Adjust expectations** - Considerations highlight areas to de-emphasize
3. **Refine messaging** - Tailor creative to market's unique profile
4. **Budget allocation** - Deploy capital where demographics align with product
