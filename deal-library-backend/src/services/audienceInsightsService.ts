TASK: Generate a SINGLE insight (2-3 sentences max) that reveals the SPECIFIC CONSUMER MINDSET and underlying motivations, with actionable implications for marketing.

STRICTLY FORBIDDEN - DO NOT USE ANY OF THESE GENERIC PHRASES:

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Dig into the SPECIFIC PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE and motivations
2. Identify the EXACT MINDSET, values, or life circumstances driving both purchases
3. Think about the CONTEXT, timing, or decision-making process
4. Focus on ACTIONABLE HUMAN BEHAVIOR, not category descriptions
5. Consider life circumstances, personal goals, or situational needs
6. Make it COMPELLING and SPECIFIC - avoid generic statements
7. Include SPECIFIC CROSS-SELLING STRATEGIES (not just "content marketing")
8. Mention GEOGRAPHIC or DEMOGRAPHIC patterns if relevant
9. Suggest TIMING or SEQUENCING of purchases

EXAMPLES OF DEEP, ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS:
- "Pool & Spa buyers are frequently hosting guests and entertaining, making them prime targets for food delivery services like Uber Eats or DoorDash who can conveniently deliver meals while they're relaxing by the pool instead of spending time in the kitchen."
- "Condoms and shaving & grooming buyers are both preparing for intimate encounters - they're conscientious about personal presentation and responsible preparation for physical relationships."
- "3D printer and activewear buyers share a maker mentality: they're hands-on innovators who prefer creating solutions over buying ready-made products, applying this DIY approach to both technology and fitness."
- "Building materials and activewear buyers embody a 'fixer' mindset - they're practical people who take control of their environment through both home improvement projects and personal fitness maintenance."
- "Baby & Toddler buyers include new parents who are simultaneously preparing for their children while purchasing items for themselves, creating natural cross-category shopping patterns during this high-spending life stage."

MISSION: Generate world-class, data-driven marketing strategy for the "${segment}" Commerce Audience (${category} category) that a Fortune 500 CMO would pay $50,000 for.

=== IMPORTANT CONTEXT: SELECTION BIAS ===
This segment is PRE-SELECTED from high-commerce-activity ZIPs. ALL commerce segments over-index vs US national average due to:
1. Higher purchasing power (online shoppers have more disposable income)
2. Tech access (internet, devices, credit cards)
3. Peak earning age (30-50 typical)

THEREFORE: Focus on comparing to "Commerce Baseline" (typical online shopper) NOT national average.

COMMERCE BASELINE (Typical Online Shopper):
- Median HHI: $${commerceBaseline.medianHHI.toLocaleString()}
- Education: ${commerceBaseline.educationBachelorsPlus.toFixed(1)}% Bachelor's+
- Age: ${commerceBaseline.medianAge.toFixed(1)} years

${segment} vs Commerce Baseline:
- Income: ${vsCommerce.income >= 0 ? '+' : ''}${vsCommerce.income.toFixed(1)}% ${vsCommerce.income > 15 ? '(Above-Average Shopper)' : vsCommerce.income > -15 ? '(Typical Shopper)' : '(Value-Conscious Shopper)'}

THIS IS THE KEY DIFFERENTIATION - use this to position the segment!
