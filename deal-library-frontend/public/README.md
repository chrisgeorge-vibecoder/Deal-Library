# Public Assets Directory

## Sovrn Logo Setup

To fix the broken logo image, you need to:

1. **Copy your JPG logo file** to this directory
2. **Rename it to**: `sovrn-logo.jpg`
3. **The file should be located at**: `/Users/cgeorge/Deal Library/deal-library-frontend/public/sovrn-logo.jpg`

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Public directory created
- ‚ùå Logo file not yet added
- üîÑ Waiting for you to add the JPG file

Once you add the logo file, the application will automatically display it in the header.
